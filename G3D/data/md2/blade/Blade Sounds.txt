Blade Soundpack-------

	by Pharaoh


  All sounds were sampled from New Line Cinema's DVD "Blade"...all sampling/editing was done with Cool Edit Pro.  And if you're wondering why there's 8 death sounds, it's because there were too many cool samples to pick from.  This way, instead of me assuming what you will like, you can just rename your favorite 4 as death1-4 to hear whichever ones your little ears desire.  Have a nice day  :-)


---->any info on the Blade model can be read in the included blade.txt file<----



  Need some sounds for a ppm?  Like what I'm doing?  Hate what I'm doing?  Let me know!
