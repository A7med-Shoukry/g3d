The Baneblade super-heavy tank from the Warhammer 40,000 game.

This model was created with the free 3D modelling and animation program OpenFX.

For some reason OpenFX will not export this particular model in 3DS format with its' textures. The textures are included so all that means is taking time to apply them yourself, sorry :(

If you have problems with smoothing when you first open the model then I recommend turning smoothing OFF for the whole model and then put it back ON for areas that need it.

This model was created for a unit animation for the Civilization III game which you can see at http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=93914

The geometry of this model is copyright of Stephen Upton (aka Muffins)
