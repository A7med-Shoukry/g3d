Additional Thanks to    : Fresh Team - For what we accomplished together.  We did what
                          no one else did online; develop maps as a team effort.  Sure,
                          the maps were owned by the individual authors and fully
                          developed by one author.  But it was the team that moved the
                          level from merely good to something great. The feedback and
                          support was something I will miss.

                          By far one of the best memories I will always have of mapping
                          will be with this team of amazing artists and designers.

                          In July, 2001 we decided to call it quits after three years
                          of mapping together.  It was a tough call, but it had to be
                          done.  Real life finally had managed to catch us.

                          Fresh Team has closed its doors but the designs live
                          on forever.  Thanks to all of you!
