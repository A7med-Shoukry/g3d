Description	: Another cool texture set from Lunaran and by
		  sheer coincidence another map from me :-) This
		  time it was Lun's LUN3DM3 texture set which
		  inspired a spell of mapping. The map is a
		  medium to large affair which will require at
		  least 4 players to get the most out of it.
		  
		  I know the r_speeds are a bit excessive in the
		  central area but I went to town with the
		  curves and trim and it looked nice so I wasn't
		  about to remove it all ;-)
		  
		  Hope you have as much fun playing the map as I
		  have had making it. Thanks for reading.

		  Thanks to my house mate Willi Hammes for
		  teaching me Max, building the cool looking
		  rocks, doing the funky slime shader and sky
		  box. Check out his amazing 3d stuff at:

Simply extract the mkvdv.pk3 file and this text file into your 
Quake III "baseq3" directory. So for me this would be
"C:\games\quake3\baseq3". Once installed the map will appear in
the Single Player Skirmish menu.
