CREDITS

Evil lair for the evil 8 textures
MrLycon for the energy effects I added to the bounce pads & walls etc
Skybox by Sock (slightly edited by me to make it less blue & lighter)

All the custom textures/shaders added by me were based on either id or evil lair or MyLycon originals (except thr radiation signs, they are mine)

Special thanks to Pete the Ladd for the idea of doing an insta CTF map and feedback on its design.

Notes

This is a rerelease.  The original has a problem in unlagged insta when the flag is sacrificed. That has now been fixed.

Oh and I also shoved an extra map in! As it uses the same texture set it doesnt take up much space. The reason it isnt getting a full relese is that it is slightly flawed. I couldnt get the bots to work so there is no support for them. Also because it is mostly curves (the reason the bot compile failed) it takes a while to load up and the fps are not what I would like. Having said all that it's kinda fun so I didnt want to scrap it totaly. The map is Curvature. It was originaly going to be instactf2 but now its just instactf1-x. It has no arena file so you need to call it from the console or vote it. \map instactf1-x

Have fun
