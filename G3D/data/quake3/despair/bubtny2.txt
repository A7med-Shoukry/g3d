info

This is my latest creation. A total of....(guessing) 40 hours of work. My first 
released tourney map. Well it started as a tourney, but it works really well as a
FFA with up to 4 people. It is sort of a empty reservoir in the desert, I think. It
plays pretty well and bots always give me a challenge. If you like it or dislike
or find any problems, e-mail me at the above e-mail.
