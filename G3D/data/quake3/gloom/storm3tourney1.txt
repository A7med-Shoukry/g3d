Copywrite info:		This map may not be distributed for profit.  If you want to distribute it over the internet or include it in a map
			pack you MUST include this readme.txt and give me proper credit, or get my permission (justiningels@hotmail.com)

Other notes:		This map plays incredibly well against human competitors, its very fast paced and fun.  It loses a bit of challenge
			when played with bots (as all maps do) but it still flows quite well as a tourney map.  Hope you enjoy the map!
