* Model Description * 

My third Quake3 map object model, it's a wall portal for
level designers to use in Quake3:Arena maps.

* Notes * 

I made the the model in Mac Lightwave6.
EarthQuake (http://urbanterror.net) made the skinmap.
Hoplit (hoplit@planetquake.com) converted it to .md3 and
fixed some bugs.

* How to use this map object/add to your maps *

Place the "scripts" and "models" folders into  your
"baseq3" folder but make sure NOT to overwrite any other
files, if you have those folders already place the
"wallportal.shader" file into your "scripts" folder and the
"wallportal" folder inside your "/models/mapobjects/"
folder. 

This should be how your Quake3 folder directory should look
like using this mapobject:
Quake3/baseq3/scripts/wallportal.shader
Quake3/baseq3/models/mapobjects/wallportal/wallportal.md3
Quake3/baseq3/models/mapobjects/wallportal/<all other image
(.tga) files>

In Q3radiant right click wherever you want and select the
"misc-model" option. Close the browser and type this in the
"key" and "value" in the boxes from the new floating window:
Key: "model"
Value: "models/mapobjects/wallportal/wallportal.md3"
