Authors notes         :	modeled in lightwave (6 hours), 1 hour for skins, 2 hours in 3ds Max, worked out how to put some jiggle on the breasts, but used steed's lucy.bip as a base but could not get it to work, so substitute major.bip (so some of the jiggle may be broken~ tried to fix most of this)

i do not have intelectual copywrite of the image of someone else, so i don't mind what you do with this skin, however if you use the contents of mds-lisab.pk3 (and try to keep file intact) to make money, you perhaps should pay most of it to the muse for this skin, http://www.lisa-boyle.com/
