data.zip contains the most-commonly loaded data files.  
To run your G3D programs on computers without G3D installed, 
distribute data.zip in the same directory as the executable (or don't
load default data files).  If you're using dynamically-linked
FFMPEG, you'll also need the *.dll files from G3D/bin on Windows.
