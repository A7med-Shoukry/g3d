Title			: Liquid Carbon
Date         		: 1-1-2002
Filename     		: map-charon3dm11v2.pk3

Description		: A very dark, very green map. Electricity, green slime,
			: black brick, and solid steel beams make up the soul of
			: the map. Slightly inspired by a really cool anime
			: series called "Lain", but really has nothing much
			: at all to do with it. This is a ffa or tourney map,
			: to whichever is your liking. This map uses my own textures
			: created from the ground up with no base textures used.
			: You may also download these textures from my site as a
			: seperate zip file. They are called "Liquid Carbon Texture Set 1".

Update			: This is version2 of this map. It corrects a few minor bugs
			: that were found that irritated me. Namely a clipping issue
			: and a bot spawning issue.

Additional Credits to   : id software, Dfused, WyldWeyr, Normal, Speed, Scampie,
			: Maj, goetz, Dietz, and especially the Burial-Grounds.com
			: crew such as spynx_w2k, Osiriss1281, and BudToker.
			: Also thanks goes out to those of you I might have missed.
