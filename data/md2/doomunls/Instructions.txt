Instructions fit for a newbie! =)

To get the Doom Unleashed to work:

Find whatever drive QuakeII is on.  If you don't know where that is, I recommend taking your computer back to the store, it will do someone else more good than you! =)

Go to the folder called "Quake2"
Go to the folder called "baseq2"
Go to the folder called "players"
unzip the file phxdul.zip INTO the folder called "players"
This makes a NEW folder called "Doomunls"
When you start Quake II, go to Multiplayer
Go to Player Setup
Choose Doomunls for the Model
And choose whatever skin you want!

-------------------------------------------
To get Doomunls to work with Rocket Arena 2:

AFTER you have done the above:

Go to the folder called "Quake2"
Go to the folder called "baseq2"
Go to the folder called "players"
RENAME the folder called "cyborg".  Call it "Cyborg2"
COPY the folder called "Doomunls"
A new folder appears called "Copy of Doomunls"
RENAME the folder called "Copy of Doomunls".  Call it "Cyborg"

When you play Rocket Arena, choose the Cyborg model.
The model is CALLED cyborg, but it shows the Doom Unleashed Doomguy instead!

-------------------------------------------
To RESTORE the original Cyborg model:
DELETE the folder called "Cyborg" (NOT CYBORG2!!!!)
(Note:  It is UNWISE to delete this folder if you did NOT
do the above Rocket Arena installation!)
RENAME the folder called "Cyborg2".  Call it "Cyborg"
That's it!

-------------------------------------------
To get the Doom Weapons models to work:
Go to the Doomunls folder
COPY a file called "pak8.pak"
PASTE it into the folder called "baseq2"
All your weapons will now look like the DOOM weapons!!

If you only want DOOM WEAPON models for Rocket Arena:
Instead of the above:
Go to the Doomunls folder
COPY a file called "pak8.pak"
PASTE it into the folder called "ARENA"
Your weapons will look like Doom ONLY in Rocket Arena!

-------------------------------------------
To get the Doom Weapon sounds to work:

Go to the Doomunls folder
COPY a file called "pak9.pak"
PASTE it into the folder called "baseq2"
All your weapons will now sound different.

If you only want DOOM WEAPON sounds for Rocket Arena:

Instead of the above:
Go to the Doomunls folder
COPY a file called "pak9.pak"
PASTE it into the folder called "ARENA"
Your weapons will sound like Doom ONLY in Rocket Arena!
You can substiture ANY mod folder for "arena"

-------------------------------------------
To DISABLE the DOOM WEAPON sounds:

Go to baseq2 (or the appropriate mod folder)
DELETE the file called "pak9.pak"
DO NOT DELETE ANY OTHER PAK FILES OR QUAKE2 WILL NOT WORK!
(And I am not responsible for stupid mistakes either!)
All weapons will sound like normal again.

Pak9.pak is still in the Doomunls folder, and can be copied
out again in the future if you want!

-------------------------------------------
To DISABLE the DOOM WEAPON graphics:

Go to baseq2 (or the appropriate mod folder)
DELETE the file called "pak8.pak"
DO NOT DELETE ANY OTHER PAK FILES OR QUAKE2 WILL NOT WORK!
(And I am not responsible for stupid mistakes either!)
All weapons will look like normal again.

Pak8.pak is still in the Doomunls folder, and can be copied
out again in the future if you want!


Well, if you couldn't follow those instructions,
How DO you get any frags!??

Happy Gaming!
