**NOTE!!!**
You will NOT see the lower half of the body in the player select screen.
THIS IS NORMAL!  This particular model is built a bit differently from your
normal player model, in that the tris.md2, which is usually the player model,
is just the upper half of Maul, and the weapon.md2, which is usually just the
weapon model, is the lower half and lightsabre for Maul.  This was done VERY
much intentionaly, it is NOT accidental.  There are a few reasons I did it this way:
1) It gave us nearly twice as much area for textures, so we could do a lot of really fine detail in the skin
2) When Maul dies, the weapon model is removed, which in this case is the light sabre
   and lower body...so the deaths are in the spirit of Maul's demise in the movie.
   i.e. it's gruesome and neat.
3) It's something different, I wanted to try something different.
So...you don't see all of him in the player select screen, but he shows up in the game.

I promise.

Don't sweat it.

Go play now.

Model description       : Some extra from a movie that came out not too long ago, in galaxy not too far away.

Wrath: Like what?  What should I put here?  This is a model that I'm sure everyone wants, and a character that initially I had zero interest in.  I agreed to do it, partially because I KNEW that people would like him regardless of what I thought of him, and partially to get Big Poppa Pump off my back.  The 2nd part of that backfired on me.

Wrath: Then I went and actually watched the film...came home after it, and put in a good 6 hours of work on him.  At that point, I knew that I wouldn't be doing the skin, and that I was going to do my best damn work for the animations I could concievably do.  The character is that good.  I don't feel that this is the ultimate Maul model...far from it actually.  There are things that I simply cannot do because of limitations of the Q2 animation format, and things that I COULD conceivably do, but am just too damn lazy...all of which would make the model a hundred times better.

Wrath: MrRogers and I have tried to collaborate on models before, and things have just kinda fallen through...but I'm glad he was able to find time to work on Maul, as he's an INCREDIBLY talented artist.  And he is, in my opinion...one of the best skin artists ANYWHERE.

Feel free to use this model in any fashion you want.  Provided you DON'T do the following:

1)Don't do anything that relates to making money off this model.  This should be common sense.

2)Don't modify this model in any way.  You're not gonna be able to use it as a base for another model...don't paint crappy skins for him...he doesn't need to be changed in any way, thank you very much.  Appreciate it.

3)This is NOT a clan model.  I don't care what your clan is, I don't care if you're clan Darth Maul.  This model is NOT a clan model.  If your clan wants to use it...fine.  But by god, if ANYONE you're playing with demands that you not use this model cause it's their clan's, tell them to fuck off.  Get their clan's name, and email it to me and I'll tell them to fuck off too.  Be nice, play nice.

4)If you're wanting to use this model in a mod or anything of that nature, that's fine...drop me a line and lemme know at least (I will probably be able to provide you with extra material to help out), and we'd better damn well get credit for it somewhere.  Note rule #1 though...
