Model description       : 

This is Angela from the Spawn Comic book.  

Other info  :      	

By creating this PPM, I tried to do a character with some complex animations, more complex that what is possible to do while using the ID Software method. A model with upper body animations, and animated Tags. So Angela is what I came up with. This model is not segmented at the waist and it can throw it's gun in the Taunt motion. I spent way more time animating this model than all my last Q3A ppms (together!). I'm really proud of the Deaths anims, I beleive they are out of the ordinary. The Skinwork is by far the best beleive I ever made, and I had a lot of fun playing with the Shaders. I recorded some sounds from the Spawn Animated movie.
