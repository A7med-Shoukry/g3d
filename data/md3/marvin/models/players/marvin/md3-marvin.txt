Additional Credits to   :  First and foremost to my wife for supporting 
me in all my efforts. Secondly to Mike McMillen for taking the time to 
help me learn to model and finally to all the great people on Polycount, 
Quake3World and Milkshape message boards like Rat, LDAsh, NoSERider and others .. 
this would have quite possibly been an insurmountable task without the 
support of all these people.

* Authors Notes *



Marvin is my first player model ever.


I had particular design goals for this model and the first was to create Marvin the 
Martian with as low a polycount as possible. I learned a lot, I made a 
lot of mistakes. Most of the mistakes I found and corrected to the point
where there is no single aspect of this model that wasn't redone or touched
up  at least 3 times. Yes the mappings, the model itself, the animations,
the skins.. its all been gone over with a fine tooth comb. 


I humbly present this as my personal best at this time.


Before you email me asking why didn't I color Marvin this way, or model
him that way please see the following message board thread It should
answer most of those questions: 
http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~polycount/ubb/Forum2/HTML/003049.html?00006


The animations in particular were challenging I'm aware of a few small
clipping problems but they are usually either isolated to one
frame such as the 'fire weapon' frame and very minor and thusly probably
never be seen in action, or due to the size of the Q3 weapons some of
them with larger back ends or tops may clip through part of his helmet
or chinguard on occaison but I tried to make it so that wouldn't
happen in general. .. his feet are very large and presented problems
getting a natural looking walk and backpeddle type of animations ..
never mind the crouch! I feel I captured his trademark run very well by
making a very non-traditional run animation and then upping the speed at which it
plays. It came off  really well on my computer and I hope it looks as good
on yours. I was mildly dissapointed that his taunt animation I could not give
him his trademark fists at his side and run back and forth little angry
sequence, however the Q3A animation system doesn't allow me  to animate
the lower body for a taunt animation and therefore I opted for a less
character fullfilling taunt but one that worked reasonably well for me. 


Also I was unable to give him his 'chest forward' type
of stance much of the time .. partially due to the low polygon
choices I had made and partially due to the times I would most have liked to
do it were whenthe animation was keyed to the lower half of the body.


I wanted this to be a model that could grace almost anyones hard drive -
thus the low poly count. And then secondly I gave him the best skinpak
I could imagine, a wide variety of fun and unique characters that have
the marvin physique to make them very stylized, funny, and most of all
fun to play and play against. I've been doing skins for a few years
now so theres no excuses there - the mappings were done by me and every
skin in this pak is my work as well. 


I did find I made one mistake late into the game after
having already redoing his mappings twice (for a total of 3 times) and that
was a minor problem of an area near his thumb was backwards .. I lived
with it by making that area non-detailed on most of the skins. Other
than the default Marvin skins the rest of them were done last and this problem
didnt present itself until late in the game. Other than the thumb the rest
of the mapping layout.. I feel like I did a good job, I got the coverage
I wanted in the areas that needed it with little warping.


I do have to say this was my first major effort on shaders and in particular
I had a really hard time with the Darth Marvin shader.
The first 4 hours I spent trying to use Q3ASE and create his shader were
disastrous and caused  Q3A to do very wacky things like turn the main menu
all white and loose all the shader effects on all of the models! Once I
stopped using Q3ASE I got it up and running I had some tough choices to make between
natural skin being more detailed or shader sections to darth shiny plastic
look - very darth-like, but less detailed. I think I struck a good balance in
the end but I was pretty unhappy with his cape - my personal lowpoint of the
skinpack, to have done it right I'd really have needed a modeled cape and
thats not in the cards for him in this implementation.


This readme is a little bit long, but I figure theres two types of people -
those who love readme's and those who don't read them at all. :)


Enjoy!

* Construction *
Poly Count              : 713
Vert Count              : 522
Skin Count              : 10
Base                    : modeled from scratch


Editor used             : built in 3DSMax, boned and animated in Milkshape


Known Bugs              : Marginal joint clipping in some extreme poses due to rigidity of the physique system in Milkshape. Damage sounds can be repetetive but its the best I could come up with sounds off the net.


Build Time              : Original model done in about 5 hours, modifications for better deformation were done after my first run through adding another 2 hours.


Animation Time          : My first animation for this model took about 8 hours or so, the second run through took about 5 hours and the final tweaking took about 3 hours. (This does not include time learning about keyframing, the animation.cfg files etc. )
